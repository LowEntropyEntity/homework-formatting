## Problem

Raindrops fall $1700 \: m$ from a cloud to the ground.

If they were not slowed by air resistance, how fast would the drops be moving when they struck the ground?

## solution

$a = -9.807 \: m/s^2$

$v = \int a \: dt = -9.807t \: m/s$

$-1700 = \int v \: dt = -4.9035t^2 \: m$

$t = \sqrt{\frac{1700}{4.9035}} = 18.620 \: s$

$speed = 9.807 \cdot 18.620 \approx \boxed{180 \: m/s}$
